# RodriguezMorales_et_al_2025

In this repository is possible to access to the code used in the analysis of the snRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics (Visium) of the associated manuscript.

* Analysis of the snRNA-seq is available [Processing_snRNAseq](Analysis_Scripts/Processing_snRNAseq.py) and [snRNA_scVI](Analysis_Scripts/snRNA_scVI.ipynb)
* Analysis of the spatial transcriptomics is available [Processing_ST](Analysis_Scripts/Processing_ST.py) and [Run_c2l](Analysis_Scripts/Run_c2l.py) and  [MistyR](Analysis_Scripts/MistyR.R)
* The script used to generated all the figures and extended figures is available [here](Analysis_Scripts/Generate_Figures). The cytoscape network used to generate figure 2d is available [here](Analysis_Scripts/GSEA_Network.cys)
* The associated functions used for the analysis are available in [davidrPackage](davidrPackage/) more information of the content can be found [here](davidrPackage/README.md) 

The supplementary tables associated to the manuscript are available [here](SUP_Tables/).
